# About

The Keycloak Operator is a Kubernetes operator developed by [**Hostzero**](https://hostzero.com) that manages Keycloak instances through the [Keycloak Admin API][1]. The overall goal is to provide a cloud-native management interface for Keycloak instances.

## Features

- **Declarative Configuration**: Manage Keycloak resources as Kubernetes Custom Resources
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Changes to CRs are automatically applied to Keycloak
- **Secret Management**: Client secrets are automatically synced to Kubernetes Secrets
- **Status Tracking**: Resource status reflects the current state in Keycloak
- **Finalizers**: Proper cleanup when resources are deleted

## Goals

* Manage Keycloak instances solely through Kubernetes resources
* Provide a GitOps-friendly way to manage Keycloak configuration
* Enable infrastructure-as-code for identity management
* Support multiple Keycloak instances from a single operator

## Non-Goals

* Manage the deployment of Keycloak instances (use Keycloak Operator or Helm for that)
* Support other IdM solutions than Keycloak

## Supported Resources

The operator manages Keycloak through a set of Custom Resource Definitions covering instances, realms, clients, users, groups, roles, identity providers, federation components, authentication flows, organizations, and more.

A minimal example looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.hostzero.com/v1beta1
kind: KeycloakRealm
metadata:
  name: my-realm
spec:
  instanceRef:
    name: my-keycloak
  definition:
    realm: my-realm
    enabled: true
    displayName: My Realm
```

See [Custom Resource Definitions](./crds.md) for the full list of supported resources and their schemas.
